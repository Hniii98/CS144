- For multiple flows sharing the same link, who allocate the link resource to those flows? (Not a single router, or chromecast) Say two flows share 10 Mbits/s. Then,it could possibly be:  
  - 5 Mbit/s \+ 5 Mbit/s  
  - 2.5 Mbit/s \+ 7.5 Mbit/s  
  - 0 Mbit/s \+ 10 Mbit/s  
  - 0 Mbit/s \+ 5 Mbit/s (this is a collapse)  
  - 0 Mbit/s \+ 10 Mbit/s but every packet is sent twice (throughput 10 Mbit/s but “goodput” 5 Mbit/s, this is also a collapse)  
- Maximize total utility  
  - i U(xi)     s.t.   x1 \+ x2  10   
  - If U(x)=(x), this gives x1= x2=5 because log(x) has diminish return (log'(x) decreases as x increases)  
- What happens if a host does not follow the congestion control? (Eventually ISP may regulate the host, but) congestion control is a voluntary restraint.  
- Real-life congestion control: we don’t know the bottleneck link rate, or how many people are sharing the link. Then, how do we decide what is the “right” speed to send data?  
- From last week: Single-flow, single-hop model  
  - S(ender) —--------- X(router) —---------- R(receiver) with r \= 1 Gbit/s and propagation delay \= 1 second  
  - The sender sends a datagram, still waiting for the corresponding ackno, where could the datagram be (in the sender’s mind):  
    - Propagating on the link  
    - Waiting at the router queue (bottleneck queue)  
    - Could have been received by the receiver, but ackno still on the way back  
    - Or the datagram or the ackno is lost/dropped  
- Easiest approach of flow-control: window\_size.   
  - We could have both: 1\) receiver’s window and 2\) “congestion window”. The minimum of the two cap the actual window.  
  - “Self-clocking”: a new byte is sent only after a byte is acked (or judged lost)  
  - Wrong window size is okay (see below), but wrong rate would lead to more dangerous situations (e.g. queue overflow).  
- How much data can be “on the link”?  
  - The BDP (Bottleneck link rate Delay Product): RTT \* link rate   
- The ideal value for window size for one flow  
  - If the window size is greater than BDP, packets queue up at routers. (At the steady state, window size \- BDP bytes is queued at the bottleneck, not so bad).  
  - If the window size is smaller than BDP, the bottleneck link may be idle. (Some part of the link would be wasted, bust still not so bad)  
  - With one flow, BDP is the ideal window. Any window less than BDP \+ max queue size is “no loss” window.  
- Say two flows share 10 Mbits/s and RTT \= 100ms.  
  - One flow, good window \~ 10 Mbit/s \* 100ms \= 1 Mbit \= 100 kByte  
  - Two flow, good window: 50 kByte for each flow  
- BUT, the “ideal” window is unknown at runtime. How to approximate the right congestion window without knowing: RTT, bottleneck link rate, and number of flows  
- Ideas for congestion signals:  
  - d throughputd cwnd   
  - (experienced) RTT starts increasing  
  - Packet loss
